Actually, the slice header is the struct of slice itself above mentioned.\n// SliceHeader is the runtime representation of a slice.\n// It cannot be used safely or portably and its representation may\n// change in a later release.\n// Moreover, the Data field is not sufficient to guarantee the data\n// it references will not be garbage collected, so programs must keep\n// a separate, correctly typed pointer to the underlying data.\ntype SliceHeader struct {\n    Data uintptr\n    Len  int\n    Cap  int\n}\nOk, let's understand these 2 addresses with dlv debugger.\nTwo Addresses - string slice\nLet's use this piece code to understand these 2 addresses. First, let's look at string slice\nfunc StringSliceAddresses() {\n\n    a := make([]string, 0, 2)\n    fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    a = append(a, \"a1\")\n    fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n\n    b := make([]string, 2, 2)\n    b[0] = \"b0\"\n    fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n    b = append(b, \"b2\")\n    fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n\n}\nIn this code gist, fmt.Println(\"%p, %p\\n\", a, &a), would print the addresses of the array under layer and the slice header\nLet's use the dlv tool to verify this.\n\nLaunch the main.go with dlv tool. You may do this by:\n\ndlv debug main.go\nb main.main // set breakpoint at entry point\n\nAnd then, let's exam the memory of a \n\n> github.com/brofu/deepingo/slice.StringSliceAddresses() ./slice/examples.go:10 (PC: 0x10aea9f)\n     5: )\n     6:\n     7: func StringSliceAddresses() {\n     8:\n     9:         a := make([]string, 0, 2)\n=>  10:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    11:         a = append(a, \"a1\")\n    12:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    13:\n    14:         b := make([]string, 2, 2)\n    15:         b[0] = \"b0\"\n(dlv) n\na: 0xc0000be000, 0xc0000ac018   // NOTE: here, we got 2 addresses\n> github.com/brofu/deepingo/slice.StringSliceAddresses() ./slice/examples.go:11 (PC: 0x10aeb8c)\n     6:\n     7: func StringSliceAddresses() {\n     8:\n     9:         a := make([]string, 0, 2)\n    10:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n=>  11:         a = append(a, \"a1\")\n    12:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    13:\n    14:         b := make([]string, 2, 2)\n    15:         b[0] = \"b0\"\n    16:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n(dlv) p *(*string)(0xc0000be000)       //NOTE: we print the 1st evelement in the array, and we don't have any element yet\n\"\"\n(dlv) p *(*unsafeheader.Slice)(0xc0000ac018)\ninternal/unsafeheader.Slice {Data: unsafe.Pointer(0xc0000be000), Len: 0, Cap: 2} //NOTE: we print the `SliceHeader`, by the address of a \n(dlv) n\n> github.com/brofu/deepingo/slice.StringSliceAddresses() ./slice/examples.go:12 (PC: 0x10aec3d)\n     7: func StringSliceAddresses() {\n     8:\n     9:         a := make([]string, 0, 2)\n    10:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    11:         a = append(a, \"a1\")\n=>  12:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    13:\n    14:         b := make([]string, 2, 2)\n    15:         b[0] = \"b0\"\n    16:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n    17:         b = append(b, \"b2\")\n(dlv) n\na: 0xc0000be000, 0xc0000ac018   //NOTE: the address of the array under layer doens't change.\n> github.com/brofu/deepingo/slice.StringSliceAddresses() ./slice/examples.go:14 (PC: 0x10aed2c)\n     9:         a := make([]string, 0, 2)\n    10:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    11:         a = append(a, \"a1\")\n    12:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    13:\n=>  14:         b := make([]string, 2, 2)\n    15:         b[0] = \"b0\"\n    16:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n    17:         b = append(b, \"b2\")\n    18:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n    19:\n(dlv) p *(*string)(0xc0000be000)\n\"a1\"   //NOTE: now, we have the 1st element \"a1\"\n(dlv) p *(*unsafeheader.Slice)(0xc0000ac018)\ninternal/unsafeheader.Slice {Data: unsafe.Pointer(0xc0000be000), Len: 1, Cap: 2}  //NOTE: the length of the array under layer changed.\n\nNow, let's continue with b\n\n(dlv) n\n> github.com/brofu/deepingo/slice.StringSliceAddresses() ./slice/examples.go:15 (PC: 0x10aed87)\n    10:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    11:         a = append(a, \"a1\")\n    12:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    13:\n    14:         b := make([]string, 2, 2)\n=>  15:         b[0] = \"b0\"\n    16:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n    17:         b = append(b, \"b2\")\n    18:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n    19:\n    20: }\n(dlv) n\n> github.com/brofu/deepingo/slice.StringSliceAddresses() ./slice/examples.go:16 (PC: 0x10aedd2)\n    11:         a = append(a, \"a1\")\n    12:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    13:\n    14:         b := make([]string, 2, 2)\n    15:         b[0] = \"b0\"\n=>  16:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n    17:         b = append(b, \"b2\")\n    18:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n    19:\n    20: }\n(dlv) n\nb: 0xc0000be020, 0xc0000ac060\n> github.com/brofu/deepingo/slice.StringSliceAddresses() ./slice/examples.go:17 (PC: 0x10aeece)\n    12:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n    13:\n    14:         b := make([]string, 2, 2)\n    15:         b[0] = \"b0\"\n    16:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n=>  17:         b = append(b, \"b2\")\n    18:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n    19:\n    20: }\n(dlv) p *(*string)(0xc0000be020)\n\"b0\"  //NOTE: we have \"b0\"\n(dlv) p *(*unsafeheader.Slice)(0xc0000ac060)\ninternal/unsafeheader.Slice {Data: unsafe.Pointer(0xc0000be020), Len: 2, Cap: 2} //NOTE: the `Slice Header` data\n\n(dlv) n\n> github.com/brofu/deepingo/slice.StringSliceAddresses() ./slice/examples.go:18 (PC: 0x10aef7f)\n    13:\n    14:         b := make([]string, 2, 2)\n    15:         b[0] = \"b0\"\n    16:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n    17:         b = append(b, \"b2\")\n=>  18:         fmt.Printf(\"b: %p, %p\\n\", b, &b)\n    19:\n    20: }\n(dlv) n\nb: 0xc0000b8040, 0xc0000ac060  //NOTE: the address of the array under layer changed.

Considering that, the length of pointer (to string) on a 64bit system should be 8? \nLet's discuss this in next section.\nTwo Addresses - string\nThe answer to above mentioned question is, the data stored in the under layer array, is the String Header itself, instead of the pointer to the string (presented by a String Header) \nHow to understand this?\n\nstring in golang is just a read-only slice of bytes\nIt's presented by reflect.StringHeader, which contains a pointer to the data and length, each takes 8 bytes on 64 bit system\nIn the under layer array of string slice, the StringHeader itself is stored. (Instead of a pointer pointing to it)\n\nThe refelct.StringHeader: \n// StringHeader is the runtime representation of a string.\n// It cannot be used safely or portably and its representation may\n// change in a later release.\n// Moreover, the Data field is not sufficient to guarantee the data\n// it references will not be garbage collected, so programs must keep\n// a separate, correctly typed pointer to the underlying data.\ntype StringHeader struct {\n    Data uintptr\n    Len  int\n}\nSo actually there are 2 addresses for string also. And the hidden address is pointing to the under layer read-only bytes array\n(dlv) n\n> github.com/brofu/deepingo/slice.StringAddresses() ./slice/examples.go:25 (PC: 0x10aea7a)\n    20:\n    21: }\n    22:\n    23: func StringAddresses() {\n    24:         a := \"test\"\n=>  25:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p\\n\", &a)\n    26: }\n    27:\n    28: func IntegerSliceAddresses() {\n    29:\n    30:         a := make([]int, 2, 2)                                                                                                                 (dlv) n                                                                                                                                                a: 0xc000010250\n> github.com/brofu/deepingo/slice.StringAddresses() ./slice/examples.go:26 (PC: 0x10aeae5)\n    21: }                                                                                                                                                  22:                                                                                                                                                    23: func StringAddresses() {                                                                                                                           24:         a := \"test\"\n    25:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p\\n\", &a)\n=>  26: }\n    27:\n    28: func IntegerSliceAddresses() {\n    29:\n    30:         a := make([]int, 2, 2)\n    31:         fmt.Printf(\"a: %p, %p\\n\", a, &a)\n(dlv) p *(*unsafeheader.String)(0xc000010250)\ninternal/unsafeheader.String {Data: unsafe.Pointer(0x10c67b7), Len: 4}  //NOTE: the address of bytes array is 0x10c67b7\nTwo Addresses - integer slice\nSimilar mechanism for integer slice.

The marking phase identifies which objects are still reachable from the root set (global variables, stack variables, etc.). Objects that are still in use are marked as reachable.\nSweeping. After marking, the sweeping phase begins. This phase reclaims the memory occupied by unreachable objects and returns it to the heap for future allocations.  \nPacing. The GC dynamically adjusts its pace based on the application's allocation rate. This adaptive pacing ensures that garbage collection keeps up with the application's memory usage without introducing significant pauses\n\nMarking\nTri-color Marking Algorithm\nRoles\nObjects are marked with 3 colors, \n\nwhite (unreachable),  \ngray (reachable but not fully processed), and \nblack (reachable and fully processed). \n\nWorkflow\n\nInital State \nInitially, all objects in the heap are conceptually white. \nThe GC starts with a small number of roots, which are marked grepy and added to the grey set\nRoots are the entry points to the object graph (global variables, stack variables, and registers).\n\n\nMarking Phase\nThe algorithm processes each gray node by marking it black and processing its references. \nIf a referenced node is white, it is marked gray and added to the gray set.\nRepeat this process.\nThis process is running concurrently and incrementally.\n\n\nMarking Completion\nWhen the gray set is empty, all reachable nodes are black.\nAny remaining white nodes are unreachable and can be reclaimed by the garbage collector.\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\nThe STW time is very short. How?\nConcurrent Marking.  The Go GC is concurrent, meaning it can run alongside the application (mutator). \nIncremental Marking. The marking work is broken down into small chunks, and the objects are being marked incrementally. \n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nHow make sure all the objects are correctly marked? (Given that the marking progress is running concurrently with the application)\n\nThe GC uses a `write barrier to ensure that any changes to object references made by the application are correctly tracked during the marking phase.\nTri-Color Invariant\nNo black object points to a white object. This ensures that all reachable objects are eventually marked.\nIf a gray object points to a white object, the white object is also marked gray.\n\n\n\n\nWhy Golang GC can NOT remove the STW event totally?\nThere are several scenarios the GC need to STW to make sure the process correctly.\na. Roots Scan.\n\nRoots of All goroutines need to scan, which includes global variables, local variables and registers. In a concurrent system like Go, where multiple goroutines are running, each goroutineâ€™s stack and registers may contain references to heap objects. These are part of the root set that needs to be scanned.\nEnsuring Consistency: To get a consistent snapshot of the roots, the GC must pause all goroutines at safe points. This ensures that no references are modified while the GC is scanning the roots, preventing inconsistencies.\n\nb. Write Barriers and Tri-color Invariant\n\nDuring certain phases, the GC may need to apply these write barriers globally, requiring a brief pause to update references and maintain consistency.\n\nc. Concurrent Marking Completion\n\nSTW for another cycle of Roots scan.\nPrepare for the Transition to Sweep Phase. (To make sure the marking is completely finished also. TODO: More checking)\n\n\nAn example of STW event caused by Write Barriers and Tri-color Invariant?\nLet's check this code.\n package main\n\n import (\n     \"runtime\"\n     \"time\"\n )\n\n type Node struct {\n     value int\n     next  *Node\n }\n\n func main() {\n     root := &Node{value: 1}\n     root.next = &Node{value: 2}\n     root.next.next = &Node{value: 3}\n\n     // Start a goroutine that mutates the object graph\n     go func() {\n         for {\n             root.next.next = &Node{value: 4}\n             time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)\n         }\n     }()\n\n     // Trigger periodic garbage collections\n     for i := 0; i \nBefore Mutation: root -> black, root.next -> black, root.next.next -> white \nDuring Mutation: The application changes root.next.next to point to a new node, which is white. The write barrier ensures that the new node is marked gray if it is white, maintaining the tri-color invariant.\nAfter Mutation: The GC can then safely continue its marking phase.\nTODO: More checking\n\n\nIn the question of 3. Is it OK to stop the goroutine which is updating the root.next.next ONLY? Why need to STW?\nTODO: More checking\n\n\nSweeping\n"},"30-programming/10-Golang/02-under_layer/02-under_layer/31-gc/01-code.html":{"url":"30-programming/10-Golang/02-under_layer/02-under_layer/31-gc/01-code.html","title":"Code","keywords":"","body":""},"30-programming/10-Golang/02-under_layer/02-under_layer/31-gc/02-tools.html":{"url":"30-programming/10-Golang/02-under_layer/02-under_layer/31-gc/02-tools.html","title":"Tools","keywords":"","body":""},"30-programming/10-Golang/02-under_layer/02-under_layer/sync/readme.html":{"url":"30-programming/10-Golang/02-under_layer/02-under_layer/sync/readme.html","title":"Sync","keywords":"","body":"sync.Once\nSource Code\ntype Once struct {\n    done uint32\n    m    Mutex\n}\n\nfunc (o *Once) Do(f func()) {\n    if atomic.LoadUint32(&o.done) == 0 { \n        o.doSlow(f)\n    }\n}\n\nfunc (o *Once) doSlow(f func()) {\n    o.m.Lock()\n    defer o.m.Unlock()\n    if o.done == 0 {\n        defer atomic.StoreUint32(&o.done, 1)\n        f()\n    }\n}\nKey Points\n\nA Once must not be copied after first use. Since defer atomic.StoreUint32(&o.done, 1) would update o.done by address\nWhy done is the first?    \n`It is first in the struct because it is used in the hot path. The hot path is inlined at every call site. Placing done first allows more compact instructions on some architectures (amd64/386), and fewer instructions (to calculate offset) on other architectures.\nIn short, o.done is high frequently accessed, put it first would make the performance better. \n\n\nPay attention to Deadlock. Because no call to Do returns until the one call to f returns, if f causes Do to be called, it will deadlock.\nAbout panic. If f panics, Do considers it to have returned; future calls of Do return without calling f. => How? \nWrong version of Once.Do. Why?\nif atomic.CompareAndSwapUint32(&o.done, 0, 1) {\n f()\n}\n\nDo guarantees that when it returns, f has finished. This implementation would not implement that guarantee:\n given two simultaneous calls, the winner of the cas would call f, and the second would return immediately, without waiting for the first's call to f to complete.\n This is why the slow path falls back to a mutex, and why the atomic.StoreUint32 must be delayed until after f returns.\n\nIn short, CAS would return at immediately, but lock would block the call.\n\n\n"},"30-programming/10-Golang/03-programming_paradigms/readme.html":{"url":"30-programming/10-Golang/03-programming_paradigms/readme.html","title":"Programming Paradigms","keywords":"","body":""},"30-programming/10-Golang/04-engineering/readme.html":{"url":"30-programming/10-Golang/04-engineering/readme.html","title":"Engineering","keywords":"","body":"Tools which can improve the productivity with Golang\nProject Construction\n\ncookiecutter\nConstruct the project construct \nCan customize the template \nhttps://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter\nAn template option: https://github.com/lacion/cookiecutter-golang \n\n\n\nTesting\n\ngotests\nInsert unit test codes based on the templates\nhttps://github.com/cweill/gotests\n\n\nvim-plugin available: https://github.com/buoto/gotests-vim  // install\n  go install github.com/cweill/gotests/gotests@latest\n  // install plugin\n\nNeed to define the templates. \nAn example: https://github.com/ras0q/gotests-template/blob/main/templates2/function.tmpl\n\n\nUsage  :GoTests\n  :GoTestsAll\n\n\n\n\n"},"30-programming/10-Golang/05-interviews/readme.html":{"url":"30-programming/10-Golang/05-interviews/readme.html","title":"Interviews","keywords":"","body":"Code Design\nHow to implement singleton in golang\n\nCreate instance at package importing\n\npackage singleton   \n\ntype singletonObject struct {}\nvar singletonObj = &singletonObject{}\n\nfunc GetSingletonObject () *singletonObject {\n    return singletonObj\n}\n\nInstance created when the package is imported.
